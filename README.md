# String_Concat
Unnoticed Bug in String Class in Java

Hi all,

I am an average Java coder who loves to code.
Recently I have found one issue in concat method of String class.
If anyone of you has used sonar(Code evaluator) it suggest that to use concat method 
instead of + operator.
But it seems concat() has null pointer issue. Now it gives me liberty to use + operator.
